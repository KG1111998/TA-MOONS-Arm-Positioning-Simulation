# TA-MOONS-Arm-Positioning-Simulation

This project focuses on designing and simulating a collision-free arm positioning mechanism for the TA-MOONS front optics using methodologies inspired by the Kband Multi-object Spectrograph (KMOS) of the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and Multi-object Spectroscopic Mode (MOS) of the High-Resolution Optical Spectrograph (HROS) of the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT). The system allows precise allocation of targets within a circular field of view based on celestial coordinates. A robust collision avoidance algorithm ensures safe operation, while Monte Carlo simulations validate the systemâ€™s reliability. This work demonstrates the integration of celestial mechanics, optical physics, and computational engineering to achieve a scalable solution for next-generation ground based survey telescopic instruments.

The ongoing plan consists of 4 modules where:
* Module 1: Target fetching & visualization (Aladin + Catalog + CSV)
* Module 2: YSO Grouping and Collision-Free Subset Creation
* Module 3: Sky Image Retrieval & FITS-based Target Plotting
* Module 4: Robotic Arm Positioning Simulation for TA-MOONS
